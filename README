I wrote this simple sample app to demonstrate integrating Cappuccino app with Springframework and Directwebremoting. 
This app also demonstrates how Javascript and Objective-J can co-exist.

There are several files that you should look at to understand how the whole thing works:

- web.xml
  Entries added for DWR support.
  
- applicationContext.xml
  Entries added for DWR support.
  
- index.html
  Added DWR's Javascript dependencies.
  
- AppController.j
  An example app.
  
- MSDwrProxy.j
  A proxy between Cappuccino app and DWR.

Hopefully this will be useful to java folks who are still learning. 

To those who are using eclipse: 

You can download all the files and import into your eclipse project (you may need to adjust the classpath to suit your environment setup). 

TODO:
- add support in MSDwrProxy.j for multiple parameter passing to the remote method.
- add example for integration with Hibernate
