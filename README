I wrote this simple sample app to demonstrate integrating Cappuccino app with Springframework and Directwebremoting. This app also demonstrates how Javascript and Objective-J can co-exist.

There are several files that you should look at to understand how the whole things works:

- web.xml
- applicationContext.xml
- index.html
- AppController.j
- MSDwrProxy.j

Hopefully this will be useful to java folks who are still learning.

TODO:
- add support for multiple parameter passing to the remote method.
- add example for integration with Hibernate
